Synopsis
---------

This 'Rock, Papers, Scissors' web app was built to fulfil the following user stories:

So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

Players play against a 'computer', and can either win, lose or draw.
